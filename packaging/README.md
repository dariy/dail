# Packaging

- `linux/dail.desktop`, `linux/dail.svg`: the desktop entry and icon (`app_id` and `StartupWMClass` are `dail`, which
  is also the `desktop-entry` hint of dail's notifications).
- Debian/Ubuntu: `cargo deb -p app-cli` (with [cargo-deb](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deb) installed) builds
  `target/debian/dail_<version>-1_<arch>.deb` from `[package.metadata.deb]` in `crates/app-cli/Cargo.toml`.
- `windows/dail.manifest`: embedded into `dail.exe` by `crates/app-cli/build.rs` (MSVC targets). Its
  `consoleAllocationPolicy` of `detached` stops Windows 11 24H2+ from opening a console when dail is started from
  Explorer, the Start menu or a shortcut, so only the GUI appears. Run from a terminal, dail still uses that terminal.
